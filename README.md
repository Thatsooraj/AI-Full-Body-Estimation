# AI-Full-Body-Estimation

Want to start building body pose based apps?

Maybe want to control your screen using nothing but gestures!

Well, Mediapipe and Python are the answer! In fact, in this video you'll learn the basics for getting started with Body pose detection, facial landmark estimation and hand pose detection using a single Mediapipe library and your webcam.

Behind the scenes, Mediapipe Holistic, the model shown in this video, uses deep learning models to be able to accurately detect keypoints. Using this model you can begin to prototype a whole bunch of different use cases like touchless gesture control, human sentiment analysis and could even build your own exercise counter!

1. Install Mediapipe and setup Mediapipe Holistic for Python
2. Access a real time video feed from your webcam using OpenCV
3. Detect and visualise facial landmarks, body poses and hand poses
